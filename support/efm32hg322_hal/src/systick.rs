//! The Core-M SysTick peripheral
//!
//! This is implemented in efm32gg-hal and not a generic Cortex-M HAL because the relevant
//! functionality depends not only on the peripheral but also on the (EFM32) clock source that
//! feeds it.
//!
//! This looks quite a bit like the stm32f30x-hal delays.rs
//! <https://github.com/japaric/stm32f30x-hal/blob/master/src/delay.rs> -- I tried out of curiosity
//! to come up with an own solution, and it turns out thsi is how it needs to be done
//!
//! FIXME: factor out the common parts (which should be everything except the actual numbers for
//! the clock frequency depending on the SystClkSource) into ... core-m-hal?
